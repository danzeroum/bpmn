# @buildtovalue/lint

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9bee584: Handoff 14 U-5 — lint problems dock (panel 1d). `@buildtovalue/lint` gains the
  quick-fix contract `fix(ctx) → Command` (optional per rule, additive — the
  `ValidationRule` shape is untouched): mechanical fixes for `duplicate-flow`,
  `superfluous-gateway` (remove + reconnect in ONE composite) and
  `event-endpoints`, plus versioned `LintProfile`s (`lint-etiquette@1.0.0`,
  `lint-engine@1.0.0`), `lintFindings` (issues annotated with rule/profile/source
  /fixability) and `fixCommandFor`. `@buildtovalue/react` ships `LintPanel`: a
  resizable bottom dock grouped by rule with severity tokens, row click →
  select + the SAME animated pan as search (`panViewportTo` extracted to
  `canvas/viewport.ts` and now public), Esc via the dismissal stack, "corrigir"
  = one undoable command, "Corrigir todos (N)" = ONE composite, and
  "✦ sugerir correção" routing unfixable findings through the existing copilot
  C5 pipeline (only with a host-injected `AIProvider`). Etiquette AND
  engine-readiness findings share the one surface (source tag tells them apart);
  open-dock canvas badges are stripped from exports (new `TRANSIENT_ATTRIBUTES`
  in the exporter). `@buildtovalue/adapters-bpmn` adds `lintProfileAdapter` —
  lint profiles as versioned, promotable Biblioteca artifacts with the VIGENTE
  seal, reading the same `LINT_PROFILES` registry as the panel header.
- 9bee584: Market-parity editing round (referência itens 1–7): context pad with one-click
  quick-append beside the selected node; dependency-free layered auto-layout
  (`computeLayeredLayout`) with a toolbar Arrange action, align/distribute for
  multi-selections and smart drag guides; diagram find bar (Ctrl/Cmd+F) with
  match walking and scope-aware centering; native `complexGateway` support
  (registry, shape, XML round-trip); and the new `@buildtovalue/lint` package —
  bpmnlint-style etiquette and executability rule profiles with stable issue
  codes.
